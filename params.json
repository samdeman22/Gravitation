  "body": "#Gravitation Simulator\r\nThis is a gravity visualization tool made with unity with the aim of showing how easy it is for order to arise from chaos; or perhaps just more _chaos_!\r\n\r\nCurrently the project only exists as a program that can be run in conjunction with the Unity 5 editor. I would like in the future for the UI to be versatile enough not to need the editor to fix your universe when you inevitably send it flying away ad infinitum. \r\n\r\n###Current Features\r\nVarious modes of gravitation:\r\n- linear: gravity is proportional to both the distance between any two objects and their masses\r\n- reciprocal: gravity is proportional to the mass of any two objects, and inversely to the distance\r\n- square: gravity is proportional to both the square distance between any two objects and their masses\r\n- inverse square: gravity is proportional to the mass of any two objects, and inversely to the square of the distance between them\r\n- cube: gravity is proportional to both the cube distance between any two objects and their masses\r\n- inverse cube: gravity is proportional to the masses of any two objects, and inversely to the cube of the distance\r\n- constant proportionate: gravity is proportional to only the masses of any two objects\r\n- repulsive: same as inverse square, but the force is in the opposite direction\r\n- repulsive linear: same as linear, but the force is in the opposite direciton\r\n- sinusoidal: inverse square, but multiplied by a factor of sin(t)\r\n- wobbly inverse square: inverse square, but gravitational constant is multiplied by a random number between a set range on every update\r\n- attractive random: proportional to both of the masses, and multiplied by a number between 0 and the gravitational constant\r\n- random: proportional to both masses, scaled by a random number between -G and G at every update\r\n- suicide random gravity (if you can call it that at this point) acts in completely random direction, scaled by gravitational constant\r\n- spring: for any particular mass force is proportional to both its mass and the other, the magnitude of gravity however is translated away from other mass by the factor O. For best results try setting the dampening factor higher.\r\n- spring modulo radius: same as spring, but O is multiplied further by abs(sin(Gt))",
